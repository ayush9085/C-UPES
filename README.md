 # C Language - Class Projects & Practice

## Purpose
This repository is a collection of my work in C programming, including:
- Class projects  
- Assessments  
- Practice programs for core concepts  

The code is organized into folders for quick reference and to track my progress through all exercises.

## Goal
To maintain a clean, version-controlled archive of everything I create while learning C, from basic syntax exercises to full projects.

/*Q108: Write a Program to take an integer array nums. Print an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output 1:
[24,12,8,6]

Input 2:
nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]

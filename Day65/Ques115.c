Q115: Write a program to take two strings s and t as inputs (assume all characters are lowercase). The task is to determine if s and t are valid anagrams, meaning they contain the same characters with the same frequencies. Print "Anagram" if they are, otherwise "Not Anagram".

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output 1:
Anagram

Input 2:
